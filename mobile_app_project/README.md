# Analysis of User Behavior in a Mobile App

## Project Goal

Understand user behavior in a mobile application that sells food products.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the sales funnel. Determine how users progress towards making a purchase. How many users complete the purchase, and how many get "stuck" at previous steps? At which steps specifically?
- Investigate the results of an A/A/B experiment. Designers wanted to change the fonts throughout the app, but managers were concerned that users might find it unfamiliar. They agreed to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with the old fonts and one experimental group with the new fonts. We'll determine which font performs better.

## Data Description

Each log entry represents a user action or event.  
`EventName` — event name  
`DeviceIDHash` — unique user identifier  
`EventTimestamp` — event timestamp  
`ExpId` — experiment ID: 246 and 247 are control groups, and 248 is the experimental group.

## Tools
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `A/B test`, `Vizualisation of data`, `Plotly`, `Event analytics`, `Product metrics`, `Testing statistical hypotheses`
