Some completed projects are collected here

| Project name | Description | Tools | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Analysis of the outflow of clients from the bank](https://github.com/emetsarina/Data-Analysis-projects/blob/main/bank_project/Banks%20project.ipynb) | Analysis of the churn of clients from the bank. The analysis shows which clients are leaving the bank, and also helps to make up segments of clients who tend to leave the bank.| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib` |
| [Analysis of the food service in Moscow](https://github.com/emetsarina/data-analysis-projects/blob/main/food_service_project/analysis%20of%20food%20service.ipynb) | A food service research has been prepared based on open data on public establishments in Moscow, and the data obtained has been visualized. Based on the data, a location has been selected for the opening of a new coffee shop. I used seaborn and plotly libraries in plotting| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Visualisation of the data` |
| [Analysis of User Behavior in a Mobile App](https://github.com/emetsarina/data-analysis-projects/blob/main/mobile_app_project/mobile%20app.ipynb) | In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, researched the users' path to purchase. I analyzed the results of the A/B test for introducing new fonts into the app. I compared 2 control groups with each other, and then compared them with the experimental group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `A/B test`, `Vizualisation of data`, `Plotly`, `Event analytics`, `Product metrics`, `Testing statistical hypotheses`|
| [History of TED-talks](https://github.com/emetsarina/data-analysis-projects/blob/main/TED_talks_project/history%20of%20TED-talks.ipynb) | An interactive dashboard based on TED-talks data has been prepared. The BI-tool Tableau was used to create dashboards.| `Tableau`, `Product metrics`, `Building dashboards`|
| [Decision-Making Based on Business Metrics](https://github.com/emetsarina/data-analysis-projects/blob/main/AB_test_project/A_B%20test.ipynb) | The prioritization of hypotheses was conducted using the ICE and RICE frameworks. Then, an analysis of the A/B test results was performed, including the construction of cumulative revenue, average bill, and conversion graphs by group. After that, the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average bills was calculated for both "raw" and "cleaned" data.| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`, `A/B test`|
